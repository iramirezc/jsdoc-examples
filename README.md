# JSDoc Examples

Decided to create a repo with my own [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/index.html) examples so that I can understand what I'm doing!

## How to use this repo

### As a quick reference guide

Explore any of the JS files into the `src` folder to see examples of how the code is documented with [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/index.html).

### Generating the JSDocs in your local and watch them for real!

Clone the repo:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:iramirezc/jsdoc-examples.git
```

Install dependencies:

```sh
yarn install
```

Generate JSDocs:

```sh
yarn docs
```

Open the `docs/index.html` file in your favorite browser.

> _**NOTE:** I would recommend to use a live server to watch any changes in real time. See [LiveServer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) for VSCode._
