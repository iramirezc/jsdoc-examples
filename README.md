# JSDoc Examples

I'm tired of the poor examples listed in the [JSDoc documentation](https://jsdoc.app/index.html), so I decided to create my own.

## How to use this repo

Clone it:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:iramirezc/jsdoc-examples.git
```

Install dependencies:

```sh
yarn install
```

Generate JSDocs:

```sh
yarn docs
```

Open the `docs/index.html` file in your browser.
